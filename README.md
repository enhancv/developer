### Team
A small team of developers, designers and marketing people, spread around offices in Sofia and Dublin, we've established good process for building our product, allowing people to work remote and adopting new technologies and aproaches. We also have occasional [power weeks](https://blog.enhancv.com/?s=power+week) bringing all of us together to work and play for a week.

### Technology
We're doing this with nodejs, webpack, es6, react, redux and python, on heroku and AWS. We're using [github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for our developing process with mutual code reviews and a good amount of integration & unit tests. 
We also have a some of code open sourced at https://github.com/enhancv 

### What we need
We need people with attention to detail and drive to excelence, with several projects worth of experience. Specific languages and frameworks knowledge is not that important for us as we know that good developers can pick up new tools with ease, but obviously web tech experience is a plus. You'll be working with client and server tech but if you like to concentrate on one of those you could do that as well.

Send us a line at work@enhancv.com with your resume / project examples / open source code and we can take it from there.
