# Developer
Full-time | Product team: 5-10 people | Sofia, Bulgaria

### [Enhancv](https://enhancv.com)
We're a company that is building browser-based resume editing software – widely regarded as the best one out there – with the mission to help talented people believe in themselves, and the ambition to become the world’s resume standard. More about us and values at our site:  https://enhancv.com/about.html (Open Sourced [here at github](https://github.com/enhancv/homepage))

### Team
A handpicked team working in Sofia and Dublin, we've established a good process for building and improving our product, while adopting new technologies and approaches. We also have regular [Power Weeks](https://blog.enhancv.com/?s=power+week) bringing all of us together to work and play.

### Technology
We do this with `nodejs`, `webpack`, `es6`, `react`, `redux` and `python`, on `heroku` and `AWS`. We use [github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for our developing process with mutual code reviews and a good amount of integration & unit tests.
We also have some of our code open sourced at https://github.com/enhancv. as we believe that coding in the open produces code that is well documented, tested, refined and lasting. For an in-depth technologies overview see [TECHNOLOGIES.md](TECHNOLOGIES.md).

### What we need
We need a person with attention to detail and drive for excellence, with an experience in several projects. We like to invest in proper solutions and aggressively refactor problematic areas but sometimes you should be able to get your hands dirty - [real artists ship](https://www.quora.com/What-did-Steve-Jobs-mean-by-real-artists-ship). Specific languages and frameworks knowledge is not that important for us as we know that good developers can pick up new tools with ease, but obviously web tech experience is a plus. You'll be working with both client and server tech but if you like to concentrate on one of those you could do that as well.

## How to apply
Send us a line at work@enhancv.com with your resume and project examples / open source code, and we can take it from there. We're [hiring without whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards), so we’d ask human questions during our interviews, and make a follow-up with a practical assignment after that.
